# Life-Science
To understand sequence analysis &amp; phylogenetic and few more life science applications.


Some of the platforms & relavant databases:
- Molecule Viewer
- AlphaFold Databases (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
- EMBL (https://www.embl.org/)
- RasTop
- Protein Data Bank (eg. 1a1a)
- Polyview 3D
- PLOS (Public Library of Science)



AlphaFold (Example Molecule View): 
- Protein : Probable disease resistance protein (This is the name or label of a protein. It is likely involved in disease resistance, which means it might help the plant defend itself against diseases.)
- Gene : At1g58602 (This is the unique identifier for the gene that codes for the mentioned protein. Genes are like instruction manuals for building proteins in living organisms.)
- Source organism : Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) (Arabidopsis thaliana is a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. It's often referred to as Mouse-ear cress. In this case, it's the organism from which both the gene and protein originate.)

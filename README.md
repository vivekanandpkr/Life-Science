# Life-Science
To understand sequence analysis &amp; phylogenetic and few more life science applications.


Some of the platforms & relavant databases:
- Molecule Viewer
- AlphaFold Databases (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
- EMBL (https://www.embl.org/)
- RasTop
- Protein Data Bank (eg. 1a1a)
- Polyview 3D
- PLOS (Public Library of Science)





AlphaFold (Example Molecule View): 
Protein - Probable disease resistance protein At1g58602
Gene - At1g58602
Source organism - Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)
